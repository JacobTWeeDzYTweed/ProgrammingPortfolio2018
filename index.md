## Welcome to Jacob Tweed's 2017-2018 Project Portfolio

### A Little About Myself
My name is Jacob Tweed, I am a student attending Skyline Highschool. I love video games and coding video games. 

### Projects I Have Worked On:


- [Pokedex Calculator](https://github.com/JacobTWeeDzYTweed/Calculator): I created this because I love Pokemon and calculators are very useful. This was created in a program called [Processing](https://processing.org/) The calulator does not contain all functions of a calculator but it contains basic funtions for the user to use.

- [Pong Remake](https://github.com/JacobTWeeDzYTweed/PongBall): Pong was always a fun game for me, so I decided to recreate it using C#. I created this using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). I enjoyed using this program because it made it so much easier to incorporate physics.

- [Shape Calculator](https://github.com/JacobTWeeDzYTweed/JTTShape): This program is a volume and area calculator for boxes, pyramids and spheres. I created it using [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). This program really helped me create this program fast and efficiently.
