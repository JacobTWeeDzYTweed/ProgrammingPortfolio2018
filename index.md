## Welcome to Jacob Tweed's 2017-2018 Project Portfolio

### 2017-2018 School Year
My name is Jacob Tweed, I am a student attending Skyline Highschool. I was able to take a programming class in Mr.Kapptie's 4A class. I chose C# for my language in programming. This was a really enjoyable experiance and I hope to add more projects in the future.

### Projects I Have Worked On:


- [Pokedex Calculator](https://github.com/JacobTWeeDzYTweed/Calculator): I created this because I love Pokemon and because calculators are very useful. This was created in a program called [Processing](https://processing.org/). The calulator contains all the basics functions of a calculator and can be very useful.

- [Pong Remake](https://github.com/JacobTWeeDzYTweed/PongBall): Pong was always a fun game for me, so I decided to recreate it using C#. I created this using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). The game itself is still just a basic mock up but it is still playable. It is a two player based game. It uses the up and down arrow keys and "W" and "S". I enjoyed creating this game because I was able to collaborate with people and test my skills.

- [Shape Calculator](https://github.com/JacobTWeeDzYTweed/JTTShape): This program is a volume and area calculator for boxes, pyramids and spheres. When you first start the program you type in the length, width and heigth of each the box. Next you have your pyramid and spheres which is the same concept. Sadly the only problem with this program is you have to go through all the other shapes to get to the sphere. I created this program using [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). This program really helped me create this program fast and efficiently.
